- Examples and use cases
- Consistent style and tone

When writing documentation:

2. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions
3. Include code examples where helpful
4. Use consistent formatting for commands, file names, and code blocks
5. Keep language simple and direct
6. Anticipate common questions and include them

Return well-structured markdown that's ready to be used directly.
